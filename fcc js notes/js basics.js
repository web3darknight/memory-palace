//One of the most important concepts in programming is variables.
//  A variable points to a specific memory address that stores a value.
//  Variables are given a name which can be used throughout your code to access that value.
// Declaring a variable means giving it a name. 
// In JavaScript, this is often done with the let keyword. 
// For example, here is how you would declare a hello variable:
// Variable naming follows specific rules: names can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores,
//  but cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number.
//Your character variable currently does not have a value. You can assign a value using the assignment operator
//Assigning a value to a variable at the moment of its declaration is known as initialization.

/*Arrays also have a .shift() method which will remove the first
elemenet of an array, unlike .pop() which removes the last.

the .unshift() method of an array allows you to add values
to the beginning of an array, unlike .push which adds the
value at the end of an array.
